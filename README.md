# Getting Started
extractor.py, separator.py, and validator.py are all files holding a number of different RE functions.  They are not meant to be run, so open them with $ atom name to view the functions and see if they would help.

test_extractor.py, test_separator.py, and test_validator.py are all test files for their namesake files.  To run them first make sure you've run $ pip install -r requirements.txt.  Once you've done that enter $ py.test in the directory and it will automatically find and run the tests.

## Description
These files are a number of RE functions made to practice finding, extracting, and separating different bits of string data.
